# Car-Dealership-Database

The most interesting part was designing Zelda-themed sample data. By naming vehicles after franchise elements (like the 'Master Cycle' motorcycle or 'Sand Seal' convertible) and using thematic VINs (e.g., 'TRIFORCE098765432'), the project became both a functional database and a tribute to the game series. This showed how real-world business data can adapt to creative themes.

Interesting Piece: The Zelda-Themed Sample Data Insertions

```

INSERT INTO vehicles (VIN, make, model, year, SOLD, color, vehicletype, odometer, price) VALUES
('ZELDA123456789012', 'Hylian', 'Master Cycle', 2023, FALSE, 'Blue', 'Motorcycle', 500, 15000.00),
('TRIFORCE098765432', 'Sheikah', 'Slate Mobile', 2022, FALSE, 'Black', 'SUV', 1200, 35000.00),
('GODDESS567890123', 'Goron', 'Rolling Boulder', 2021, FALSE, 'Red', 'Truck', 3500, 28000.00);

```
## Why This Is Interesting:
- Transforms a generic car dealership into a Legend of Zelda universe

- Creative vehicle names like "Sheikah Slate Mobile" and "Goron Rolling Boulder"

- VINs use franchise terms (ZELDA, TRIFORCE, etc.)
